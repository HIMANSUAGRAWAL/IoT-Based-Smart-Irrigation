# 🌱 IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System  

## 📌 Project Description  
The **IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System** is designed to optimize water usage in agriculture by automating irrigation based on real-time soil and environmental conditions. This project leverages **IoT, sensors, and edge computing** to ensure efficient water management, reduce wastage, and increase crop yield.  

The system monitors **soil moisture, temperature, and humidity** using sensors connected to a **Raspberry Pi (or microcontroller)**. Based on predefined thresholds, it automatically controls the **water pump**. Data is stored and visualized for analysis, allowing farmers to make informed decisions. Integration with **cloud platforms and APIs** makes the system scalable and adaptable for **smart farming applications**.
